# TW MOST RECENT WORK - SUMMARY

## format_data.ipynb
- We will agree on the best way to get dummies etc. but this is how I do it
- Running this script will create new files of 'correctly' formatted data and save them in the data folder
- train_X is too large for pickle so it is saved in two separate files
- In my other scripts you can see how I load everything in
